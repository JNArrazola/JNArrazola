# Heya bro
I’m Joshua, an **AI & NLP researcher** and **software engineer** with a strong focus on **language models, semantic retrieval systems, and algorithmic problem solving**. My work spans **applied machine learning, backend engineering, and data-intensive architectures**, with an emphasis on building systems that work at scale.

I currently collaborate with the **Institute for the Future of Education (Tecnológico de Monterrey)**, where I design and implement **semantic search architectures**, **embedding-based retrieval pipelines**, and **LLM-driven models** for forecasting and analytical applications.

I also develop **custom web solutions** for big content creators and digital brands.

Don't really wanna sound too linkediny, if u want to know more about me, check out:
